CoDeco App: Secret Language Encoder/Decoder
The CoDeco App is a Python-based application that encodes and decodes secret messages using a simple algorithm. This project is my first Python project, and it showcases the basics of message encoding and decoding in a fun and interactive way.

Features:
Randomized Encoding: The app uses randomly chosen prefixes and suffixes to encode words with three or more characters.
Reversible Decoding: Users can decode messages back to their original form if they know the correct password.
Customizable Secret Word: You can set your own secret word password for decoding.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use with a simple text-based input system.
How It Works:
Encoding: Words longer than three characters are shuffled with a random prefix and suffix. Shorter words are reversed.
Decoding: The secret password allows users to reverse the encoding process and retrieve the original message.
Quit Option: Type "Q" to exit the app.
This project was a great learning experience, and I hope you find it fun to use as well. Start encoding your messages with CoDeco today!
